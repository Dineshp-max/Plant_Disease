#Citrus_Plant_Disease
1. Introduction:
   Agriculture is crucial for food production and income generation. Citrus fruits play a key role in agriculture but are vulnerable to diseases like black spot and canker. Early detection using deep learning technology can help farmers improve yields. A new method proposes three phases for segmenting and classifying citrus leaf diseases, with promising results in detecting affected areas accurately.
   
2. Features:
